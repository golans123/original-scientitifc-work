A Mathematical Framework for the Science of Medicine

Definition: a surjective (onto) function is a called a disease iff its domain is a physiological space
(a state of health) and its range is a pathological space (a state of dis-ease).





Definition: a random variable X: Omega to R is called a medical feature (measure) iff its domain is a set of results and it's range is the result's appropriate values.

Definition: a vector space R^m is called a physiological space iff all of its elements are...

Definition: a pathological space is a.



it maps a healthy patient to its corresponding sick patient according to the disease.
map patient-by-patient or a single patient feature-by-feature? anyway, the function is onto.



(a set of random variables X: Omega to R, each representing a medical feature.)

Definition: a patient is a.
